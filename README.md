# 2856 First Tech Challenge

To understand the contents of this repository, the autonomous code is a good place to start. Navigate to Autonomous/TubeGrabWithTurn.c to see an example of the code we ran at state. This code uses a gyroscope and wheel encoders to reliable score a ball in the medium tube and move the tube into the parking zone.

Additionally, our I2C code is an interesting and essential part of our robot's functioning. It was custom written to interface with the motor controllers, which precisely control the robots speed with a PID algorithm. To see this code navigate to the  [libraries repository](https://github.com/saasrobotics/Libraries), then look for Motors.h.

This is where all of the code for the 2856 team goes. It includes the autonomous and teliop code. This repo is managed by Isaac Zinda.
